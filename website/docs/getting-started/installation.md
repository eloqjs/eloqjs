Add **@eloqjs/core** dependency to your project:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @eloqjs/core
```

:::caution

If you are using the `dev` version of `@eloqjs/core`, you should fix your `package.json` to the exact version that you
develop with to avoid updating with breaking changes since package is auto published.
